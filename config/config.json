Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n                \\[\n                x = \frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}\n                \\]\n\n                Simplifying the terms inside the square root:\n\n                \\[\n                x = \frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{4}\n                \\]\n\n                \\[\n                x = \frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{4}\n                \\]\n\n                Now, taking the square root of 49:\n\n                \\[\n                x = \frac{-3 \\pm 7}{4}\n                \\]\n\n                Therefore, the two possible solutions are:\n\n                \\[\n                x = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = 1 \\quad \text{or} \\quad x = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = -2.5\n                \\]\n\n                Thus, the solutions are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2.5\\).\n               \n            Question 2 is an example question in natural language. \n               \n            Question 3: What is the area of a circle with a radius of 5 cm ?\n\n            Answer:\n\n            To calculate the area of a circle, we use the formula:\n\n            \\[\n            A = \\pi r^2\n            \\]\n\n            where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. For a circle with radius \\( r = 5 \\) cm, we substitute the value of \\( r \\) into the formula:\n\n            \\[\n            A = \\pi (5)^2 = 25\\pi\n            \\]\n\n            Thus, the area is \\( 25\\pi \\) square centimeters. Using an approximation for \\( \\pi \\) (about 3.1416), we get:\n\n            \\[\n            A \u0007pprox 25 \times 3.1416 = 78.54 \\, \text{cm}^2\n            \\]\n\n            Therefore, the area of the circle is approximately \\( 78.54 \\, \text{cm}^2 \\).\n            \n            4. Out-of-Context Question: What is the capital of France?\n                Answer:\n                This is not a math-related question, so no mathematical solution is required.\n                I have been instructed to provide only math-related answers.
